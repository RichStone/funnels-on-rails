# The Vibe

This is mostly blind-vibe-coded, use with caution and only execute in safe environments since it makes use of Claude Code `--dangerously-skip-permissions`.

## Requirements

- Claude Code CLI installed.
- Ghostty Terminal installed.
- Longer running agentic workflows that you don't want to be blocking your worktree.
